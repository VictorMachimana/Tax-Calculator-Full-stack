GET- The GET method is used to extract information from the given server using a given URI. While using GET request, it should only extract data and should have no other effect on the data.

POST- A POST request is used to create a new entity. It can also be used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.

PUT- Create a new entity or update an existing one.

DELETE- Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI.
